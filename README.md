# Telecom Churn Analysis

In recent years, the telecom market has been very competitive. The cost of retaining existing telecom customers is lower than attracting new customers. It is necessary for a telecom company to understand customer churn through customer relationship management (CRM). 

Feature construction of the churn dataset includes equidistant grouping of customer behavior features to expand the space of features and discover latent information from the churn dataset. The original and new churn datasets are analyzed in the stacking ensemble model with four evaluation metrics. The experimental results show that the proposed customer churn predictions have accuracies of 96.12% and 98.09% for the original and new churn datasets, respectively. These results are better than state-of-the-art churn recognition systems.


## Problem Statement 

Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.

In this problem statement we were required to explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

In this project we are –
1.	Analyzing the given data set to know the reasons of churn
2.	Suggesting ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

## Conclusion
The analysis of CSV file helped us determine important factors affecting customer purchasing behavior in the telecommunications industry. We have analysed all the factors carefully and came to conclusion that there were several shortcomings in the services of Orange Telecom Inc. 

Basic reasons for Customer Churn were –
1.	Number of customer care calls
2.	Voice Mail Message 
3.	Poor service during day time , evening time, and nigh time for churn customers
4.	Poor service for customers having International Calls
5.	Churn because of problem in some specific States
6.	Churn because of Customer Service

On the basis of our analysis we gave various recommendations. I believe that on implementing these points Churn rate can be reduced drastically.
